## Environment configuration for mam-audiofinder
#
# Many app-level options (MAM cookie, qB URL/user/pass, library path, path mapping)
# can also be set later via the web setup UI at /setup, which writes /data/config.json.
# If a value exists in /data/config.json, it overrides the corresponding env var
# below; env vars act as defaults/fallbacks.
#
# Section 1: required env vars for all setups (not configurable in the web UI).
# Section 2: optional app config that can also live in /data/config.json
#            (often set via the setup UI) – these are commented out by default.

# -------------------------------
# 1) Required env vars (all setups)
# -------------------------------

# --- app webUI port ---
APP_PORT=8008

# --- host mounts (adjust to your system) ---
MEDIA_ROOT=/path/to/media-root    # host path mounted at /media inside this container (used in the default single-mount setup)
DATA_DIR=/path/to/appdata/mam-audiofinder/data

# If your qB downloads and Audiobookshelf library share a common parent and
# filesystem, set MEDIA_ROOT to that parent and point DL_DIR / LIB_DIR under
# /media (see README “Single media root” example).
#
# If they live on completely separate host paths (or you prefer not to mount
# a large tree), you can ignore MEDIA_ROOT and instead mount each path
# explicitly in docker-compose (e.g. /downloads and /library) and set DL_DIR
# and LIB_DIR to those in-container paths (see README “Separate mounts”).

# --- container user/perm ---
PUID=99
PGID=100
UMASK=0002

# --- optional: lock setup UI after configuration (env-only) ---
# DISABLE_SETUP=1               # when set, hides the setup button and disables /setup and /api/setup

# -----------------------------------------------------
# 2) Optional app config (can also be set via /setup)
# -----------------------------------------------------

# --- MAM and qBittorrent credentials ---
# MAM_COOKIE=mam_id=your_cookie_here
# QB_URL=http://qbittorrent:8080
# QB_USER=youruser
# QB_PASS=yourpass

# --- in-container paths (adjust for your media layout) ---
# DL_DIR=/media/torrents            # qB "content path" mapped into this container (or /downloads in the separate-mount layout)
# LIB_DIR=/media/audiobookshelf     # Audiobookshelf library path inside this container (or /library in the separate-mount layout)

# --- import behavior & qbittorrent category ---
# IMPORT_MODE=link                  # options: link | copy | move
# QB_CATEGORY=mam-audiofinder       # category to assign new torrents. removed after import.
# QB_POSTIMPORT_CATEGORY=           # category to set after import (empty = none)

# --- qB save path and tags ---
# QB_SAVEPATH=                      # optional explicit save path for new torrents (otherwise qB's default is used)
# QB_TAGS=MAM,audiobook             # comma-separated tags applied to new torrents

# --- qB internal download prefix mapping ---
# QB_INNER_DL_PREFIX=/downloads
# QB_PATH_MAP=qb_prefix=/downloads;other_qb=/other/path
